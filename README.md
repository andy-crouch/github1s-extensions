# GitHub 1s Extensions

![GitHub 1s Extensions](screenshot.png)

This repository contains the source code for the GitHub 1s related browser extensions that I have developed.

Each extension adds a button to your browser extension icons so that when viewing a GitHub repository your can enable the extension to view the repository with VS Code from within your browser.

The core functionality is provided by the [GitHub1s](https://github.com/conwnet/github1s) project. The extensions here merely use the url feature provided by GitHub1s to enable the ability to view a repository within VS Code. Thanks should go to the project for a genuinely useful feature they have provided.
